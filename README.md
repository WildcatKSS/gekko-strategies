## The strategies

The standaard strategies are nice but they are not a winning team. Therefore I created some strategies of my own based on trading theories and strategies I found all over the internet.

### Theory

#### Indicators

When it comes to indicators, we can devide them into three classes:

- momentum indicators
- trend-following indicators
- volatility indicators

Knowing which one belongs to which category, and how to combine the best indicators in a meaningful way can help you make much better trading decisions. On the other hand, combining indicators in a wrong way can lead to a lot of confusion, wrong price interpretation and, subsequently, to wrong trading decisions.

#### Indicator categories

The following table arranges the most commonly used indicators by categories. Now, you can avoid using indicators that are from the same category and combine indicators from different categories that complement each other.

#### Indicator redundancy – duplicate signals

Indicator redundancy means that a trader uses different indicators which belong to the same indicator class and then show the same information on a trader’s charts.
