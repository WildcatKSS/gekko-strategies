Additional strategies for Gekko

Here you can find additonal strategies for the cryptocoin trading bot Gekko.

## Gekko

Without Gekko these stategies are worth nothing. So before you continue, if you havent done it already, install and run [Gekko](https://gekko.wizb.it/) first.

## The strategies

The standaard strategies are nice but they are not a winning team. Therefore I created some strategies of my own based on trading theories and strategies I found all over the internet.

### Indicators

When it comes to indicators, we can devide them into three classes:

    momentum indicators
    trend-following indicators
    volatility indicators

Knowing which one belongs to which category, and how to combine the best indicators in a meaningful way can help you make much better trading decisions. On the other hand, combining indicators in a wrong way can lead to a lot of confusion, wrong price interpretation and, subsequently, to wrong trading decisions. Not good!

Indicator redundancy – duplicate signals

Indicator redundancy means that a trader uses different indicators which belong to the same indicator class and then show the same information on a trader’s charts.

The screenshot below shows a chart with 3 momentum indicators (MACD, RSI and the Stochastic). Essentially, all 3 indicators provide the same information because they examine momentum in price behavior.

You can see that all indicators rise and fall simultaneously, turn together and also are flat during no-momentum periods (red boxes).
